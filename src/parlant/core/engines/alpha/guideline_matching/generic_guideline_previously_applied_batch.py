GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------
In our system, the behavior of a conversational AI agent is guided by "guidelines". The agent makes use of these guidelines whenever it interacts with a user (also referred to as the customer).
Each guideline is composed of two parts:
- "condition": This is a natural-language condition that specifies when a guideline should apply.
          We look at each conversation at any particular state, and we test against this
          condition to understand if we should have this guideline participate in generating
          the next reply to the user.
- "action": This is a natural-language instruction that should be followed by the agent
          whenever the "condition" part of the guideline applies to the conversation in its particular state.
          Any instruction described here applies only to the agent, and not to the user.


Task Description
----------------
You will be given a set of guidelines, each associated with an action that has already been applied one or more times during the conversation.

In general, a guideline should be reapplied if:
1. The condition is met again for a new reason in the most recent user message, and
2. The associated action has not yet been taken in response to this new occurrence, but still needs to be.

Your task is to determine whether reapplying the action is appropriate, based on whether the guideline’s condition is met again in a way that justifies repeating the action. We will want to repeat the action if the current application refers
 to a new or subtly different context or information
For example, a guideline with the condition “the customer is asking a question” should be reapplied each time the customer asks a new question. 
In contrast, guidelines involving one-time behaviors (e.g., “send the user our address”) should be reapplied more conservatively: only if the condition ceased to be true for a while and is now clearly true again in the current context.
For instance, if the customer previously complained about an issue and you already offered compensation, then mentions the same issue again, it is usually not necessary to repeat the compensation offer. However, if the customer raises a new
 issue or clearly indicates a different concern, it may warrant reapplying the guideline.

-- Focusing on the most recent context --
When evaluating whether a guideline should be reapplied, the most recent part of the conversation, specifically the last user message, is what matters. A guideline should only be reapplied if its condition is clearly met again in that latest message.
Always base your decision on the current context to avoid unnecessary repetition and to keep the response aligned with the user’s present needs.
Context May Shift:
    Sometimes, the user may briefly raise an issue that would normally trigger a guideline, but then shift the topic within the same message or shortly after. In such cases, the condition should NOT be considered active, and the guideline should
    not be reapplied.
Conditions Can Arise and Resolve Multiple Times:
    A condition may be met more than once over the course of a conversation and may also be resolved multiple times (the action was taken). If the most recent instance of the condition has already been addressed and resolved, there is no need to 
    reapply the guideline. However, if the user is still clearly engaging with the same unresolved issue, or if a new instance of the condition arises, reapplying the guideline may be appropriate.


The conversation and guidelines will follow. Instructions on how to format your response will be provided after that.
