GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------
In our system, the behavior of a conversational AI agent is guided by "guidelines". The agent makes use of these guidelines whenever it interacts with a user (also referred to as the customer).
Each guideline is composed of two parts:
- "condition": This is a natural-language condition that specifies when a guideline should apply.
          We look at each conversation at any particular state, and we test against this
          condition to understand if we should have this guideline participate in generating
          the next reply to the user.
- "action": This is a natural-language instruction that should be followed by the agent
          whenever the "condition" part of the guideline applies to the conversation in its particular state.
          Any instruction described here applies only to the agent, and not to the user.

While an action can only instruct the agent to do something, some guidelines may require something from the customer in order to be completed. These are referred to as "customer dependent" guidelines.
For example, the action "e.g., get the customer's ID number" requires the agent to ask the customer what's their account number, but the guideline is not fully completed until the user provides it.

Task Description
----------------
Your task is to evaluate the relevance and applicability of a set of provided guidelines to the most recent state of an interaction between yourself (an AI agent) and a user.
Specifically, you will be given a set of "customer dependent" guidelines after we know that the agent part was fulfilled  (i.e., the agent has already performed its part of the action) at least once at 
some point during the interaction. 

The guideline should be apply if either of the following is true:
1. The condition still holds, the reason that triggered the agent to make it's part of the action is still relevant, AND the customer has not yet fulfilled their side of the action.
    Example: The agent asked for the user’s ID, but the user has not responded yet, and the current conversation is still about accessing their account.
2. The condition arises again in a new context and the associated action should be repeated (by the agent and the user)
    Example: The user switches to asking about a second account, and the agent needs to ask for another ID.


Additional KeyRules:

Conditions May Arise Multiple Times
    As said before, if the same condition comes up again later in a new context, and the associated action should be repeated (e.g., asking for a different account ID), the guideline should be reapplied.
    - We will want to repeat the action only if the current application refers to a new or subtly different context or information.
    - We will also want to make sure the nre context justify to retake the action. For example, a guideline “get the item title when the customer wants to purchase an item” should be reapplied each time the customer asks 
    to buy something. In contrast, guidelines involving constant information (e.g., “ask for the user ID”) should not be apply again since this information has not changed.

Focus on the most recent context 
When evaluating whether a guideline should be reapplied, the most recent part of the conversation, specifically the last user message, is what matters. A guideline should only be reapplied if its condition is clearly met 
again in that latest message.
Always base your decision on the current context to avoid unnecessary repetition and to keep the response aligned with the user’s present needs.

Context May Shift:
    Sometimes, the user may briefly raise an issue that would normally trigger a guideline, but then shift the topic within the same message or shortly after. In such cases, the condition should NOT be considered active, 
    and the guideline should not be reapplied.
Conditions Can Arise and Resolve Multiple Times:
    A condition may be met more than once over the course of a conversation and may also be resolved multiple times (the action was taken). If the most recent instance of the condition has already been addressed and resolved,
    there is no need to reapply the guideline. However, if the user is still clearly engaging with the same unresolved issue, or if a new instance of the condition arises, reapplying the guideline may be appropriate.


The conversation and guidelines will follow. Instructions on how to format your response will be provided after that.
